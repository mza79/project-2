## Test suite
**QuidPHP/Project** test suite contains about 14000 assertions which can thoroughly test your setup. In order to run the test suite, follow the Installation steps and then do the following:
1. Import [sql/test.sql.zip](sql/test.sql.zip) within a new Mysql/MariaDB database.
2. Update the scheme hosts and database parameters within the [env.php](env.php) file. Note that will now be booting assert, not app.
3. From your web browser, enter the URL to the [public/test.php](public/test.php) entry file.
4. Please delete the test suite files once the run has been successful.

### Known issue
- On some setup, you may need to add your domain to the system hosts file. If not, some assertions involving curl may fail.
- On Windows, you will need to add *lower_case_table_names* = 2 in your database configuration file (my.cnf). The table and column names need to be stored in their natural case.
